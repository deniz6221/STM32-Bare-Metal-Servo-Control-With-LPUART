## STM32 Bare Metal LPUART Code To Control A Servo Motor

This code is developed using STM32CubeIDE. Users can press the capital letter O to set the servo motor's angle to 90 degrees. 
Similarly, pressing the capital letter C adjusts the servo motor's angle to 0 degrees relative to the horizontal axis. Upon each valid key press, the STM32 transmits the servo's state to the computer terminal.
